- I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Guy Rothblum](https://guyrothblum.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}
- My research focuses on issues of fairness and non-discrimination in machine learning. More generally, I am interested in the computational perspectives of incorporating societal concerns, such as interpretability and privacy, into machine learning methods.
- I periodically blog about general machine learning topics at [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/@galyona){:target="_blank"}
