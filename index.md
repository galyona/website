- I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://weizmann.ac.il){:target="_blank"}
<img class="profile-picture" img id="optionalstuff" src="imgs/small_square.jpg">. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Guy Rothblum](https://guyrothblum.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}.  
- My research focuses on issues of fairness and non-discrimination in machine learning. More broadly, I am interested in the interaction between algorithmic decision making and questions of transparency, interpretability and accountability.
- During my PhD I had the opportunity to work with [Cynthia Dwork](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-us/directory?search=%22Cynthia%20Dwork%22){:target="_blank"} as a research intern at Microsoft Research (Silicon Valley, 2019) and with [Amir Globerson](https://cs3801.wixsite.com/amirgloberson){:target="_blank"} as a research intern at Google Research (Tel Aviv, 2021). I am also generously supported by a [Google PhD fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/){:target="_blank"}.
- I periodically blog about general machine learning topics at [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/@galyona){:target="_blank"}
