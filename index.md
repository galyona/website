- I am a PhD student in Computer Science, [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://weizmann.ac.il){:target="_blank"}
<img class="profile-picture" img id="optionalstuff" src="imgs/small_square.jpg">, extremely fortunate to be advised by [Guy Rothblum](https://guyrothblum.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}
- My research focuses on issues of fairness and non-discrimination in machine learning. More generally, I am interested in the computational perspectives of incorporating societal concerns, such as interpretability and privacy, into machine learning methods.
- In 2019, I spent a wonderful summer in California as a research intern with [Cynthia Dwork](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-us/directory?search=%22Cynthia%20Dwork%22){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="_blank"}, and visiting the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
- I periodically blog about general machine learning topics at [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/@galyona){:target="_blank"}
