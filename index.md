- PhD student in Computer Science, [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://weizmann.ac.il)
- I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Guy Rothblum](https://guyrothblum.wordpress.com/)
- My research focuses on issues of fairness and non-discrimination in machine learning. More generally, I am interested in the computational perspectives of incorporating societal aspects into machine learning methods (such as interpretability and privacy).
- I periodically blog about general machine learning topics at [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/@galyona)
